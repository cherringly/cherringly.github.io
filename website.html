    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I plan to double major in computer engineering and neuroscience, 
      with a neuro concentration in computational neuroscience. 
      My primary research interest is brain-computer interfaces. 
      I hope to pursue a PhD in the future and work as a BCI researcher to expand what is possible. 
      Things like enhancing communication for tetraplegic patients, 
      generating feeling in artificial limbs, 
      recording/sharing memories to perhaps one day achieve an unprecedented level of global empathy. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      A quote I really like from Max Hodak (one of the founding members of Neuralink) 
      goes “I believe that one of the essential goals of our generation is 
      to understand the physics of consciousness and learn to engineer experience directly.”

    <h3>TMS Depression Recovery (2019) @Kristin Hooker</h3>
    <p>
      This video inspired me to pursue neuromodulation. 
      The way her face lit up as time progresses gets me every time.
